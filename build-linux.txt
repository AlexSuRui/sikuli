= How To Build Sikuli on Linux =

Prerequisite: 
   CMake 2.8+
   OpenCV 2.1+
   libtiff
   Tesseract-OCR 2.04 + English language data (3.0 won't work), 
   SWIG 1.3+
   JDK 6

The path to these dependent libraries can be set in cmake_modules/common.cmake.
You may need to add appropriate paths on your machine if cmake can not find 
the libraries automatically.

Note for Ubuntu Linux users: 
   The Ubuntu package tesseract-ocr doesn't have headers and libraries 
   for development. You need to compile and install tesseract-ocr from 
   source. 


Assume you are in the top directory of Sikuli's source tree. You can
build Sikuli IDE and Sikuli Script with the following steps.

1. make a "build" directory 
  mkdir build

2. generate makefiles with CMake
  cd build
  cmake ..

3. generate a release package. The package will be generated in "build".
  make package
